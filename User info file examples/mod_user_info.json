		// - The "Feed_num" is used to be the ID of the feed and is used as file name for the feed's notified URLs.
		//   Doesn't need to be set in order, can be any random number, just needs to be unique.
		// - The "Feed_type" is used to identify the type of feed.
		//   - For YouTube feeds, it's "YouTube [CH|PL] [+S]". "CH" for channel, "PL" for playlist, "+S" to include
		//     Shorts in the notifications. For the rest, it's "General".
		// - The "Feed_url" is the URL of the feed. For YouTube feeds, it is the channel/playlist ID.
		// - The "Custom_msg_subject" is the custom message subject for the feed. If it is empty, the default message
		//   subject will be used. For YouTube feeds, the default is based on the feed type.
